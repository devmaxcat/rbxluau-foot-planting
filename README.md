Quick Update!

I've decided to put this project on github to allow others to help out, I personally don't have that much time to put into a project and so if you want to contribute, feel free! Open an issue and then optionally submit a pull request.

# Summary
Hello, fellow developers! I created an extremely simple and easy-to-use module that integrates with any R15 game to make your character feel more realistic.

## What's foot-planting? 
Foot-Planting is the process of aligning a character's legs to match the surface they're standing on, making the character feel more realistically integrated into their environment. I wanted to make a module that would achieve this efficiently and be easy to drag-and-drop into any project.

## Examples

## How to use
Simply put the module into StarterPlayerScripts.

#### Known Issues
* The rays intersect parts which the player can't collide with (this is an easy fix I just haven't gotten to doing it yet)
* The target points don't consider the upper leg position/rotation and cause the feet to drift together
* Exaggerated animation packs often completely destroy the IK, again because I don't take into account the animation's influence on the feet position.
* Replication!

#### EDITS
5/30/2024 - Hey Y'all! I'm working on a majorly improved version of this that'll include foot planting while moving, other animation packages, and turn-in-place support. I'm taking my sweet time and getting busy with other things but it'll get done eventually
