# Summary
Hello, fellow developers! I created an extremely simple and easy-to-use module that integrates with any R15 game to make your character feel more realistic.

## What's foot-planting? 
Foot-Planting is the process of aligning a character's legs to match the surface they're standing on, making the character feel more realistically integrated into their environment. I wanted to make a module that would achieve this efficiently and be easy to drag-and-drop into any project.

## Examples

## Usage Rights
* If using the system in your game, I would appreciate credit, but ultimately it is not required.
* Please do not claim use directly as your own.
* Feel free to edit however you'd like to adjust to your own needs.
* Please do not redistribute edited versions without credit or claim system as your own.

### Feedback
I always look for feedback. I'm sure this system isn't perfect,  if anyone has any suggestions, edits, or feature requests, I'm listening. 

I can't test everything by myself, unfortunately.




Version History
``1.0.0`` - 1/9/2024 - Uploaded, Let me know of any issues you encounter.

#### Known Issues
* The rays intersect parts which the player can't collide with (this is an easy fix I just haven't gotten to doing it yet)
* The target points don't consider the upper leg position/rotation and cause the feet to drift together
* Exaggerated animation packs often completely destroy the IK, again because I don't take into account the animation's influence on the feet position.
* Replication!

#### EDITS
5/30/2024 - Hey Y'all! I'm working on a majorly improved version of this that'll include foot planting while moving, other animation packages, and turn-in-place support. I'm taking my sweet time and getting busy with other things but it'll get done eventually
